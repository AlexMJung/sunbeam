  Thank you for applying to {{ school.name }}! We look forward to getting to know you and your family better.

<div>
  We'd like to schedule a time for you to observe the school and to sit down with our school leaders for conversation.

  We know choosing a learning environment for your child is a big decision. Through this process, you’ll have the opportunity to better understand Wildflower’s principles and practices, meet our teachers and ask any questions you may have.

<div>Your actions:</div>
<ol>
    <li>
      Please <a href="{{ school.schedule_parent_observation_url }}">click here</a> to schedule your observation.
      If you’ve already observed, you don’t need to complete this step.
